Purpose
This repository defines Phase 0 of a marketing-focused prompt engineering course.
Phase 0 aligns mindset before any technical prompting begins.

Audience

Marketing teams

Content creators

Brand strategists

Key Principle

AI does not think for you.
It forces you to think clearly.

Outcome
By the end of this phase, users stop blaming AI and start fixing prompts.

00_why_this_phase_exists.md
Why Phase 0 Exists

Most prompt failures are not technical failures.
They are thinking failures.

This phase exists to:

Break the myth of AI as a creative brain

Replace “asking” with “briefing”

Establish responsibility for output quality

Skipping this phase guarantees shallow results in later phases.

01_ai_is_not_magic.md
What AI Is Not

AI:

Has no intention

Has no brand understanding

Has no business goal

It predicts text. Nothing more.

What This Means for Marketers

If you do not provide:

context

audience

tone

constraints

AI will guess. Guessing is the enemy of branding.

02_why_outputs_fail.md
Why Most AI Outputs Fail

Common causes:

Vague prompts

Missing goals

Undefined audience

No format control

Bad output is not evidence of bad AI.
It is evidence of missing structure.

03_command_vs_scenario.md
Command vs Scenario

Command (Wrong)

Write an Instagram caption for a restaurant.


Scenario (Correct)

You are a brand copywriter for a casual dining restaurant.
Target audience: 20–30 year olds.
Tone: friendly, energetic, not salesy.
Goal: increase engagement.
Output: max 2 lines.


Prompting is scenario design, not command issuing.

04_ai_and_creativity.md
Creativity Is Not Outsourced

AI does not create ideas.
It expands existing ones.

Bad idea × AI = polished nonsense
Good idea × AI = scalable creativity

AI amplifies direction, not imagination.

05_prompting_as_thinking.md
Prompting Is Thinking Out Loud

A good prompt is evidence of:

clear intent

audience awareness

brand discipline

Prompting is a thinking skill disguised as a writing skill.

exercises/ex01_bad_vs_good_prompt.md
Exercise 01 – Bad vs Good Prompt

clarity

brand alignment

How would you rewrite the prompt?
